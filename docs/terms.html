  <h1>Terms of Service — MagicCut BG</h1>
  <div class="muted">Last updated: 2025-10-31</div>

  <p>By downloading or using MagicCut BG (“App”), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

  <h2>1) License and permitted use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We grant you a personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable license to install and use the App on devices you own or control.</li>
    <li>You must not reverse engineer, resell, rent, lease, or distribute the App.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2) Your images and rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You represent that you have all rights and permissions to process any images you submit.</li>
    <li>You retain all rights in your images. The App does not claim ownership of your content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How processing works</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The desktop App sends the selected image to a local proxy (default <code>http://localhost:5055</code>) for background removal.</li>
    <li>Depending on your proxy/configuration, processing may occur locally or use third‑party services that you control or select. Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</li>
    <li>The App itself does not upload your images to our servers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Trials, subscriptions, and payments</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App may include a limited free trial and an optional subscription (“Pro”). Features, limits, and pricing may change.</li>
    <li>If you purchase via the Microsoft Store, billing, renewals, and cancellations are managed by Microsoft according to the Microsoft Store policies. Refunds (if any) are governed by Microsoft Store rules.</li>
    <li>If you purchase through other channels (if offered), the terms presented at purchase apply.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Prohibited use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Do not use the App to violate law, infringe rights, or process unlawful content.</li>
    <li>No attempts to disrupt, interfere with, or bypass security or usage limits of the App or any connected services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6) Ownership and third‑party components</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The App and its materials are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws.</li>
    <li>The App may interoperate with third‑party components or services subject to their own licenses and terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Updates and changes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We may update or change the App at any time, including adding, modifying, or removing features.</li>
    <li>We may update these Terms. Continued use after changes means you accept the updated Terms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8) No warranties</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, and non‑infringement. We do not guarantee error‑free or uninterrupted operation.</p>

  <h2>9) Limitation of liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we (and our suppliers) will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, or loss of data, profits, or business, arising from or relating to your use of the App, even if advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid for the App in the 12 months preceding the claim (or USD $10 if no amount was paid).</p>

  <h2>10) Indemnity</h2>
  <p>You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from claims arising from your misuse of the App or violation of these Terms.</p>

  <h2>11) Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you violate these Terms. You may stop using and uninstall the App at any time.</p>

  <h2>12) Governing law</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by applicable law where you reside, without regard to conflict‑of‑laws rules. Mandatory consumer protections in your jurisdiction still apply.</p>
